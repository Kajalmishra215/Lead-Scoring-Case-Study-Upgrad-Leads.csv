Problem Statement

X Education is an online learning company that offers courses to working professionals. Each day, many interested professionals visit the website and fill out a form, after which they are marked as leads. Once leads are captured, the sales team contacts them via calls and emails. Some leads convert, but most do not.The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. Now, this means if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as Hot Leads. To improve this, the company aims to identify Hot Leads—those most likely to convert—so the sales team can focus their efforts more efficiently and boost conversions.

Business Objective

Lead X has requested a model that assigns each lead a score between 0–100, helping them identify Hot Leads and improve their conversion rate.The CEO’s goal is to achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%. The model should also be designed to handle future scenarios, such as actions during peak periods, optimal use of manpower, and strategies after meeting targets.
